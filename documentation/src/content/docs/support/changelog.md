## Version 1.1.0

In version 1.1.0 of `oasismenu`, we have fixed several issues to improve the functionality of the product. Specifically:

* **Fixed \`OasisMenu\` issue with fewer than two components:** `OasisMenu` previously only worked when there were more than two components or elements, but this has now been fixed.
* **Fixed \`children\` prop treating single children as array:** We also fixed an issue with the children prop, which was being treated as an array for only single children (where it should be treated as an object).
* **Resolved issue with \`statusIcon\` not being rendered:** Finally, we have resolved an issue where the `statusIcon` was not being rendered.
